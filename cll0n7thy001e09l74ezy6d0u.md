Hello world, and welcome to this "blog".

Let us start with some simple questions:

* Why did you translate the fourth book of the Aeneid?  
    Almost two years ago I read "The Elegance of the Hedgehog", a novel by Muriel Barbery, and in the book I is reported two or three times part of the aria "When I am laid in earth" from the opera Dido and Aeneas by Henry Purcell. That aria inspired me to translate the poem.
    

* When did you start?  
    The project began in January 2022 and underwent several changes over time until it reached its current form. Originally I wanted to translate the entire Aeneid, but due to lack of time I decided to translate only the first six books and publish only the fourth.
    
* Why publish it if it is not a sophisticated translation and you are not a professional translator?  
    The reason is that I enjoyed translating the book so much that I always want to have it accessible somewhere. If my readers can get some benefit from it, that's good for them.
